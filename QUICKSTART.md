## What the Script Does

✅ Checks if Node.js is installed  
✅ Installs all dependencies automatically  
✅ Creates environment file template  
✅ Launches the development server  

**No manual setup required!**

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Node.js not found"
Install Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/

### "Permission denied"
Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup-and-launch.sh
```

### Port 3000 already in use
Stop any other apps using port 3000, or the script will use the next available port.
